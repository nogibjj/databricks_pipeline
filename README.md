## Hosting a Cloud Hosted notebook.

This week assingment was to host a cloud hosted notebook for which we did simple data science project such as an exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, modeling and forming a conclusion.

## Google Colab link

## The dataset was gotten from the famous online diamonds [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/main/data-raw/diamonds.csv). 

The dataset was loaded and explored using python standard libraries like `pandas`, `numpy` and `seaborn`.

## EDA

We did a simple exploration to see waht the number of observations our dataset contained, the types of variables in the dataset and their types, we also did a summary statistic of the dataset.

To access this notebook the link is provided above and once can just `Run All` to display all the visualisations used to set up this notebook and get a sence of the dataset and what was being done to have a sense of things involved in the dataset.

## Visualisation

There is a simple creation of a bar plot to visualise the data.

## Instructions 

- click [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13kKvK6klVb06A8t3c-a1l5tYBsX25zXh#scrollTo=7voGhdP9KpuK)
- Once the notebook is loaded in Google Colab, you can navigate through the cells and interact with the code and text.
- To execute a code cell, simply click on the cell and press the "Play" button or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter.
- If you want to run all cells in the notebook, you can do so by selecting "Runtime" in the Colab menu and then choosing "Run All."
- You can also add, modify, or annotate the code and text cells as needed to experiment with the analysis tasks.

After running the notebook, you can save your changes to your Google Drive or download the notebook to your local machine.
