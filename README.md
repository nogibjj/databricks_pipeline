## Dataset

The dataset is a Diabetes csv file that is called from a `URL` which is then run through my `main.py` file and it auntomatically creates a database for which queries can be run.
My dataset has 9 columns:
* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age
* Outcome

 with a command line tool created queries can be run using SQLite which is a fast way of quering data from the command line
